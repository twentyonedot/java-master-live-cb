5.In Blockchain, you are working on the Ethereum open-source, smart-contract functionality. Which of the following statements about key files from account management are correct:

Accounts are indexed by their addresses that are derived from a public key by using the last 32 bytes.
Each private key and address pair is encoded in a key file.
Keyfiles are found in the Keystore subdirectory of the Ethereum nodeâ€™s data directory.

6.You are provided with three processes, Process 1, Process 2, and Process 3. These processes contain three assigned resources, Resource 1, Resource 2, and Resource 3 respectively.

You observed that one resource is assigned to one process and the same process is waiting for the other resource as represented in the provided diagram. If you have implemented the resource preemption technique to recover this deadlock, then what are the disadvantages of using this technique?

Diagram

Disadvantage

No processes or resources can be selected for preemption because no order of processes is defined to utilize the resources to minimize the cost.
A frequent rollback from resources to processes allows an incomplete preemption.
There is no assurance that the resources are preempted from the same process.

8.Which of the following statements regarding the difference between threads and processes is true:

Threads take more time for termination whereas the processes take less time for termination.
Threads take less time in context switching whereas the processes take more time in context switching.
Thread switching does not require to call an operating system and cause an interrupt to the kernel whereas process switching uses an interface in the operating system.
Threads consume more resources whereas the processes consume lesser resources.
